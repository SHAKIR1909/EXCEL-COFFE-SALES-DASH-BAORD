The excel project created a dashbaord for coffee sales 
in this project all the relevant data from different tables and sheets were pulled together using xlookup,vlookup and ,indexmatch.
then the dats was formatted and cleaned 
further the data which were difficult to read for folks was redesignated values for easy understading (like short forms were converted to specific names)
after that different picot tables and charts were inserted along with relvant slicers and graphs 
finally a dyanmicdashboard to understand the sales numbers.
this would easily help the business to understnd thier most saleable type of coffe along with relvant insights about the sales numbers from different regions in the data set
this also identified the sales value over time to understand the hoe the sales changed over time
